 * junit and testng. You pass some condition and if this condition isn't true,
 * exception will be throwed</li>
 * <li><b>Soft validation.</b> Soft validation doesn't throw any exceptions in
 * the place where it's defined. If soft validation doesn't pass, error only
 * will be collected into {@link SoftFailuresHolder}</li>
